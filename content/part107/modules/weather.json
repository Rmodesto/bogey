Use when you haven't received a previous briefing.\n\n### Abbreviated Briefing\n\nUpdate to a previous briefing, or when you only need specific information. Tell the briefer what you already know.\n\n### Outlook Briefing\n\nFor planning flights **6+ hours in advance**. Gives a general picture of expected conditions.\n\n## Exam Tip\n\nThe exam will ask where to obtain weather information. Classic answer: **Flight Service (1-800-WX-BRIEF)** or **aviationweather.gov**. Know both."
