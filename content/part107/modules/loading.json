How much it can carry, how long it can stay airborne, how high it can climb, and how fast it can fly are all determined by its weight and the conditions it's flying in.\n\n## The Core Principle\n\n**More weight = more power required = less performance.**\n\nThis relationship is **not linear**. Adding 25% more weight does not simply reduce flight time by 25% — it reduces it by **more**, because motors must spin faster to generate extra lift, and power consumption increases exponentially with thrust demand.\n\n### The Physics\n\nHover power scales with approximately the 1.5 power of weight:\n- Doubling weight increases hover power by roughly **2.8×**, not 2×\n- This means performance degrades faster than weight increases\n\n## Why It Matters\n\nUnderstanding this non-linear relationship helps you:\n- Plan realistic mission durations with payload\n- Know when conditions make a flight unsafe\n- Avoid overloading your aircraft\n\n## What the Exam Tests\n\nExpect questions about:\n- How adding payload affects flight time (always reduces it)\n- Whether the reduction is proportional (no — it's worse)\n- Part 107's maximum weight limit (55 lbs)"

Every gram of payload you add forces the motors to work harder, drawing more current from the battery.\n\n| Payload Added | Approximate Endurance Reduction |\n|---|---|\n| +10% of aircraft weight | 12–15% shorter flight time |\n| +25% of aircraft weight | 25–35% shorter flight time |\n| +50% of aircraft weight | 40–55% shorter flight time |\n\n## Range\n\nRange decreases with added weight because the drone burns through its battery faster. It covers less ground before needing to return.\n\n## Maximum Speed\n\nHeavier drones have a lower top speed. More power is consumed just staying airborne, leaving less power available for forward acceleration.\n\n## Climb Rate\n\nA heavier drone climbs more slowly. If a drone rated for 300 ft/min climb at base weight adds 30% payload, expect roughly 150–200 ft/min climb rate.\n\n## Maneuverability\n\nHeavier aircraft respond more slowly to control inputs. Roll rates decrease, turn radii increase, and recovery from aggressive maneuvers takes longer.\n\n**A loaded drone is a sluggish drone.**\n\n## Maximum Achievable Altitude\n\nAt higher altitudes, air becomes thinner and propellers generate less lift per revolution. A drone that can easily hover at sea level with a full payload may struggle or fail to maintain altitude at 8,000 feet with the same load.",

The density altitude is **lower** than field elevation.\n\nYour drone performs better than the elevation would suggest — as if it were at 4,220 feet instead of 5,000.\n\n**However:** Remember that cold temperatures reduce battery performance, so the aerodynamic advantage may be offset by reduced battery output."

Always use **density altitude**.\n\n### Trap 2: Wrong Temperature Units\n**Forgetting to convert °F to °C.**\n\nThe formula uses Celsius. If the question gives Fahrenheit:\n**°C = (°F − 32) × 5/9**\n\n### Trap 3: Trusting Specs\n**Thinking manufacturer specs are guaranteed.**\n\n❌ They're best-case. Real performance is always worse.\n\n### Trap 4: Ignoring Altimeter Setting\n**Forgetting to correct pressure altitude.**\n\nIf the altimeter setting is not 29.92, you must correct the pressure altitude before calculating density altitude.\n\n### Trap 5: Dismissing Humidity\n**\"Humidity doesn't matter.\"**\n\nWhile humidity has a smaller effect than temperature or altitude, it does increase density altitude slightly. The FAA may test this concept.",
