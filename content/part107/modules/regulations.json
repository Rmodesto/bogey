What regulations apply?\"\n- \"Which operations are NOT covered by Part 107?\""

The \"system\" is the aircraft PLUS controller, data link, ground station, and display.\n\n### Remote Pilot in Command (Remote PIC)\n\nThe person who holds a Remote Pilot Certificate with sUAS rating and has **final authority and responsibility** for the operation.\n\n### Visual Observer (VO)\n\nA person designated by the remote PIC to assist with see-and-avoid duties. VOs are **optional**, not required.\n\n### Control Station\n\nThe interface (controller/tablet/GCS) used to control the flight path.\n\n### Person Manipulating Flight Controls\n\nWhoever is physically operating the sticks at any moment. May or may not be the Remote PIC.\n\n## Why It Matters\n\nThese definitions establish the **chain of responsibility**.
